# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This repository contains code and documentation for conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on various datasets. The EDA process involves examining and visualizing datasets to better understand their characteristics, relationships, and insights that can be derived from them.

## Overview

Exploratory Data Analysis is a crucial step in the data analysis process. It allows us to gain insights, detect patterns, and identify potential outliers or anomalies in the data. In this repository, we perform EDA on different datasets using Python and various data visualization libraries.



## Dependencies

pandas,
matplotlib,
seborn,
numpy

## EDA Project Status

ðŸš€ I'm actively working on the EDA project, conducting exploratory data analysis and extracting valuable insights from the data. Expect to see comprehensive visualizations and in-depth reports soon!
